### Jane Watson, a KBAI TA powered by AI.

This was a fun side-project built to help me prepare for the final KBAI exam.

The website is live at https://janewatson.xyz (but I will probably turn it down by Fall 2023).

To run it locally, you must have an `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable either set on your environment or set in a `.env` file in the root directory.

The system's pre-processed dataset is in the file `kbai.pkl`.
If you want to recreate it, you have to download all the subtitles from Canvas, place them in a directory, and run `db.py` (don't forget to adjust the path).

If you have any comments/questions/inputs, please let me know! souza@gatech.edu.
